    <string name="intro_text">I believe that the News you really need to know will always be present in the Top Ten of the your favourite News Agency. This app is built on that idea, rather than having hundreds of articles and killing your time by getting you engaged in the app. This is a non-commercial News App with the objective of saving your time with data sourced from "newsapi.org". </string>
